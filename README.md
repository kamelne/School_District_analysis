# School District Analysis
## Overview
Maria was tasked by the school board to analyze student test results and look for trends based on student grade, school budget, school size, and school type to help the board make decisions on the school's budgets. After we created the analysis model the school board informed us that there was evidence of academic dishonesty in one of the school's 9th grade class. Until more information could be gathered on the possible academic dishonesty the board asked us to emit all test scores for these students and rerun the results. Below we will discuss results and how the results were affected by the emitted scores.
